# Booger-Game
Booger Game developed by Torrance Cui 2020 using Xcode

This is a simple game based on a childhood game I would play under pine trees with my brother while waiting for our mom to pick us up from school. 
Currently in development using Xcode/Swift. 

## Rules: 
Each dead pine leaf consists of two leaves connected in the middle by a "booger". Each player pulls on one leaf until the leaf breaks apart.
The player that ends up with the "booger" loses, and the other winning player receives a point.
